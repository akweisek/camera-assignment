Assignment of camera to USB ports in Linux systems

This allows one to associate specific USB ports with IDs for connected cameras.

For instance, if one wants to develop a stereo camera, it is integral to identify the left and right cameras without mixing them up. With the code in the repository you can tag specific a specific USB port for the left camera and another for the right camera.

NB: This has been developed and tested only in Ubuntu.
